## Description
This project is on ICD (International Classification of Diseases) classification using both the machine learning's supervised and unsupervised learning mechanism. The program has been developed in Python in Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Install Jupyter Notebook
- Visit [Anaconda's official website](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- Download the Anaconda and launch Jupyter Notebook by commanding the Anaconda's terminal with "Jupyter Notebook"
- Visit [this link](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for more guidence

## Modules used
- numpy
- pandas
- pickle
- nltk
- re
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

Install third-party modules by running this command:
  pip install package_name (in Jupyter Notebook's cell)
  conda install package_name (in Anaconda's terminal)
Don't forget to replace the "package_name" with the actual name of a package that you need.

## Load and Execute This Program
- Open terminal and clone this repository using the following command:

  git clone https://github.com/El-codificador/icd_classification.git
  
  You need to install "Git" and keep it in system's PATH for this. Install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Load both the dataset and the notebook file in Jupyter's home
- Click on the loaded notebook to open the file in Jupyter
- Run all cells or run one at a time by pressing SHIFT+ENTER
